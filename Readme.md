Building
--------

Using CMake, you should be able to build this on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
This project was developed on Windows 10, so it may have hidden incompatibilities.

The game runs using the [Urho3D](http://urho3d.github.io/) engine, so you'll have
to build that before building this project.
