### RTS Racer
- Control a band of racers as they race through a violent competetive race
- Try to survive to the finish line to claim the prize
- Each unit has a unique ability (some support - healing, boosting - others attack - AOE slow, sniping attack - all can damage)

- Post-apocalyptic - bunch of four wheelers and jeeps with bulldozers and spikes
- Tribal - band of warriors (Aztec?)
- Medieval - bunch of knights in a crusade?, vikings to a new land?
- Age of exploration - sailing, sailing, right by the pirates
- Be the pirates?

### Turn-based/RTS? bullet hell
- Each turn pick your move to avoid all the bullets
- See the last turn and the next
- Sounds an aweful lot like that mech game
